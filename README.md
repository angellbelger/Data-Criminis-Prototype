ðŸš€ This repository contains a prototype of my Masterpiece.
The version you see here may be slightly outdatedâ€”intentionallyâ€”since the real system is in active operation and handles sensitive data. My goal is to showcase some models, concepts, and updated screenshots of a system designed to solve real-world problems.

I have been developing it for over three years, and today it has reached a level of maturity where it can run independently of me. Even though no project ever truly ends, this system represents a part of my legacy as a police officer, blending technology and public service to create lasting impact.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots  

Here are some highlights of the projects in this repository:
